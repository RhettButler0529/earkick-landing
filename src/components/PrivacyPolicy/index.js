      1. Collecting personal data, data and communication security
      <p>
        Personal data includes any data that is relevant to you personally, e.g. name, address, e-mail addresses, user behaviour. We process your personal data whilst observing any applicable data protection regulations, with particular reference to the European General Data Protection Regulation and any other applicable international and national laws pertaining to the processing of personal data.

      <p>
        We only collect data that is legally or contractually required, or that is necessary for the conclusion of a contract or required for us to be able to render our services and process contracts. Voluntary information is marked as such. There are no negative consequences of not providing this data. However, not providing data may in some cases make communication with you difficult or delayed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your personal data is protected against loss and misuse at all times through appropriate technical and organisational measures. It is stored in a secure operating environment that is not accessible to the public.

        Sensitive data, such as your username, password, address details and payment details, is transmitted solely via an encrypted connection. This means that communication between the app and our servers takes place via a certified encryption process.

      7. Third-party services
      <h5>
        (1) Using MailChimp
      </h5>
      <p>
        Our e-mail communication is processed via ‘MailChimp’, a platform from the US provider Rocket Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE #5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA. Your e-mail address and other data described in this policy are stored on MailChimp servers in the USA. MailChimp uses this information to send e-mails and analyse user interaction on our behalf. Furthermore, MailChimp can use this data, as per its own information, to optimise or improve its own services, e.g. to technically optimise the sending and presentation of the newsletter or for business purposes, in order to determine the countries recipients originate from. However, MailChimp does not use our newsletter recipients’ data to send messages itself, nor does it share such data with third parties. MailChimp is certified under the US-EU Privacy Shield data protection agreement and is therefore under obligation to comply with EU data protection requirements. We have also concluded a data processing agreement with MailChimp. This is a contract in which MailChimp is under obligation to protect our users’ data, to process it on our behalf in accordance with our data protection regulations, and, in particular, to not share it with third parties. Therefore, the balancing of interests shows that there are no overriding interests on your part (Article 6 [1] [f] of the GDPR).
      </p>

      <h5>
        (2) Google Firebase and Firebase Cloud Messaging
      </h5>
      <p>
        Our app uses Google Firebase (Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, ‘Google’). Among other things, this service processes personal data. This data mainly includes ‘instance IDs’, which are provided with time stamps. These IDs are assigned to a specific user and allow various events or processes to be linked. This data does not allow us to draw any conclusions about a specific user. We do not personalise the data. We process the data collected to analyse and optimise user behaviour, e.g. by evaluating crash reports.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Firebase Analytics, Google also uses the advertising ID of the end device. You can limit the use of the advertising ID in your mobile device settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        For iOS: Settings > Privacy > Advertising > Limit Ad Tracking
      </p>
      <p>
        Firebase Cloud Messaging is used to send push notifications or ‘in-app messages’ (messages that are shown in the actual app). Here, a pseudonymised push reference is assigned to the end device, which serves as the destination for the push or in-app messages. This feature can be disabled in your end device settings and can also be re-enabled at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can view the privacy policy here: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        If possible, we use servers located in the EU. But we cannot rule out that data may be transmitted to the USA. Google is part of the EU-US Privacy Shield.
